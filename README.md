# Project Title: Ecommerce Website
This project is a result of the collaborative efforts of our five-member team as part of our Software Engineering course. The aim was to design and implement a fully functional ecommerce website.

# Methodology
The Agile methodology was followed throughout the course of the project. Agile is not just a requirement but a way for us to maintain organization and manage our tasks effectively while promoting team collaboration. Our iterative approach allowed us to incrementally build on the website's functionality and adapt to changes swiftly.

# Collaboration Tools
For version control and code collaboration, we used Git with Bitbucket. It facilitated an environment where we could easily manage our codebase, maintain version history, and seamlessly integrate each other's contributions.

# Backend
Our choice of backend technologies included NodeJS and ExpressJS. We leveraged TypeScript for strong typing, helping us catch errors early in the development process. As an interface between NodeJS and MongoDB, we utilized Mongoose. The backend is designed to provide a robust and efficient REST API to serve our frontend application.

# Database
MongoDB was selected as our database solution. MongoDB's document-oriented nature provided us the flexibility to store, manage, and retrieve our complex ecommerce data efficiently.

# Frontend
The frontend was built using ReactJS, an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allowed us to create a rich, interactive UI for our ecommerce site. TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was used to design and style our application. It greatly increased our productivity by providing low-level utility classes that allowed us to build any design, directly in our markup.

# Testing
Unit testing was an integral part of our development process. We incorporated Cypress, a next-generation frontend testing tool, to write and run our unit tests. Cypress facilitated easy-to-write, reliable tests that ensured the proper functioning of our application.
